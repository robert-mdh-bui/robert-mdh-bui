# Sample Projects

## #1 [Visualizing US Airports and their NOAA stations with Python & Heroku](https://github.com/robert-mdh-bui/uge-airport-noaa-lookup)

### Context: 
- This web app is created for resource planning use at United Ground Express (a United Airlines company). 

### Problem: 
- In order to gauge each airport's need for de-icing, heat watch, and other winter operations staffing and equipment, resource planning (RP) analysts needs to determine cold months at each airport.
- Some airports do not have dedicated weather stations, in which case RP analysts need to find a weather station that lies within the same geographical proximity. 

### Solution:
- [Programmatic calculation based on data from NOAA.](https://github.com/robert-mdh-bui/uge_deicing_heatwatch_2022)
- [Visualization of airports and weather station-specific datasets.](https://github.com/robert-mdh-bui/uge-airport-noaa-lookup)

## #2 [Predicting 7-yr Prostate Cancer Survival with Machine Learning in R](https://github.com/robert-mdh-bui/ids506-healthcare-analytics/tree/main/prostate)

### Context: 
- This ML project and report is created as part of experiential learning at University of Illinois - Chicago, Liautaud Graduate Business School, course IDS.506 Healthcare Analytics.

### Problem:
- At diagnosis, healthcare providers need to gauge a patient's survivability to determine their needs for follow-up treatment timelines.

### Solution:
- Statistical machine learning methods combined with manual rule-based screens can provide a solid [33.6% predictive power uplift](https://github.com/robert-mdh-bui/ids506-healthcare-analytics/blob/e1f0fa5c47ab6204c570ebff89b35386151d1d90/prostate/ids.506%20-%20Applied%20Machine%20Learning_%20Detecting%207-year%20Prostate%20Cancer%20Survival.pdf) from null model.
- Model: [Gradient-boosted random forest ensemble (xGBoost) + manual screening rule.](https://github.com/robert-mdh-bui/ids506-healthcare-analytics/blob/main/prostate/modeling.Rmd)
